😃 Hello my name is Guiherme I'm a 24 year old Data Scientists. I'm learning lots of stuff everyday, but still will always be and work with ML stuff.

# 🚀 mission
My mission is to make data more meaninful, accessible and fun! For that sake, I try to learn a lot everyday, help as much as I can in the projects I work for and the tech community around. I feel my engineering background helped me to undertand not only data itself but how business can take most advantadge of it in their decisions.

# 🛰️ tech radar
I still study a lot on Machine Learning, Python development frameworks, JS, HTML5, CSS. Its just the beginning of my journey but its a very interesting one!
